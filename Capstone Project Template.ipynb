    "\n",
    "The data model will be comprised of one main fact table, one minor fact table, and ten supporting dimension tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main fact table - games - will contain all available information about players' performance within the context of a game. Gametime performance is the most critical piece of information to a fantasy football league participant because it directly translates into how the participant performs, as a result. All of the data is largely the \"business facts\" of the model, from the perspective of this football industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "The minor fact table can be considered an alternative to the main games table, because it is also descriptive of players' performance at a game-level. The difference is that this minor table - game_spreads - is the predictive performance and outcome, based upon sports betting professionals. When fantasy football leage participants make in-season decisions about which players to rest and to play, they often consult these data points. \n",

    "To make this data model possible the following work will be the most critical:\n",

    "1. New ID fields must be made for each table which can be joined upon (current IDs are from the source data and are not necessarily linked in any way). In many cases these IDs will be a combination of unique values. \n",
    "2. Columns must be dropped, particularly from the games and game_spreads data sets. The width of the tables in their current state is excessive, costly to performance, and difficult for users to use in a reasonable way. \n",
    "3. Field types in all tables must be modified. They were read in as primarly strings and this will not be necessary for numeric data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this we will follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Create the table structure for the primary and secondary fact tables and all dimension tables\n",
    "2. In doing 1, create the ID fields, implement correct field types and constraints, and select the necessary columns to include\n",
    "3. Build INSERT statements for each of the 12 tables, while transform the data to meet each of the criteria set forth in step 2\n",
    "4. Write execute statements to begin loading the data and evaluate whether the same statements can be used for going-forward ETL or if more lightweight logic is appropriate after this initial backfill "

    "#### Step 5: Complete Project Write Up\n",
    "* Rationale for selected tools and technologies\n",
    "  Given the size and variety of data in this project, Spark was used to process the data in a parquet columnar storage format. \n",
    "  A Redshift cluster with S3 buckets is used to store the data for future querying and analyses and player performance. \n",
    "* Latency\n",
    "  This data should be updated differently based on time-of-year. \n",
    "  The data should be processed every morning. At first, it would seem this data only needs to be updated on a weekly basis, after all games have been played. However, we do see variance in sports betting each day, as well as, trades which impact which team a player is on, who is teammates are, and whether he is injured. The stadiums data will likely not change much at all, but given the very small size of data in this table, it is trivial to keep its schedule in line with the other tables. \n",
    "* Forward-thinking stratagies:\n",
    " * If the volume of data increased 100x (which will not take long given the amount of data gathered during each season of play), we will likely need to create sub-data models for each skillset. For example, player_stats_defensive_line can be broken down into individual positions, or specific data pointss per table, i.e. tackles vs. sacks. This will help to alleviate run time of queries that do not need to pull all data points to answer a single question about a skillset. \n",
    " * If this data populated a dashboard with an SLA of 7am daily, we would begin processing the data at 2AM UTC each evening. This would allow the final data, posted by the NFL, to accumulate post-game. At this time, run time for this entire notebook is under 30 minutes. \n",
    " * If 100 people needed to access this database, we could consider how this data model might benefit different use cases. For example, some individuals would only be concerned with play conditions, which means they would not need a data model comprised of each play or each player's performance. They would be more interested in information about the stadium, the weather of each game, and the general outcome of each game. Other use cases might include understanding the demographic of each city which has an NFL team to better serve the fans or incrase fan participation at games. These users would need to see stadium, city, team, and sometimes player information (at an aggregate level). For all of these use cases and more, we could create more tables with more defined subject-areas to reduce table access and limit to only data which the users need."
